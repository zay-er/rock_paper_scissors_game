So, this took a lot longer than I expected because I lost motivation at the start.

But, after I sat down yesterday to finish, I would say the whole program took me about 3 hours.

Definitly can be better and I think I will rewrite completly if I have to do something else related to this project.

For certain I could make the decision of who wins and loses simpler, as while working on this project I read up on objects and the solution
using them is much more elegant. 

Anyway onto the next project.
